# Vlorp
A small REST API created with Kotlin, Spring Boot, Spring Web, JPA, H2 (in-memory db), Gradle, JUnit 5, and Mockito.

If this was destined to be a production app, next steps would include:
* more features
* lots more tests. Unit, functional, end-to-end. 
* input validation
* ktlint
* change from in-memory to persisted db
* specify dependency versions in build.gradle
* add spring boot monitoring

and may include:
* document the API (e.g., Swagger)
* containerize
* change server
* create a UI and/or a reference client.

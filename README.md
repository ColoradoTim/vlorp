# Vlorp
This was a take-home coding exercise for an interview where the task was to build a REST API with CRUD operations that writes data to an in-memory database, using all the technologies listed below:   

Kotlin, Spring Boot, Spring Web, JPA, H2 (in-memory db), JUnit 5, Mockito, and Gradle.

If this was destined to be a production app, next steps would include:  
* more features  
* lots more tests. Unit, functional, end-to-end  
* input validation  
* ktlint  
* change from in-memory to persisted db  
* specify dependency versions in build.gradle  
* enable spring boot monitoring

and might include:  
* document the API (e.g., Swagger)  
* containerize  
* change server  
* create a UI and/or a reference client
